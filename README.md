You can choose between 2 options: Investment and Bond.

If you choose "Investment" you would be able to calculate the amount of interest you will earn on your investment, note that you would be prompted to selected between "simple interest" and "compound interest" depending on the type of investment you are calculating. 

In both cases user would be prompted to enter some important data for formula calculations: amount of money depositing, interest rate, number of years planning to invest and finally the type of interest (simple/compound).

If you choose "Bond" you would be able to calculate the amount you will have to pay monthly on a home loan. In order to do this you would be prompted to enter some data: present value of the house, interest rate and number of months you are planning to take to repay.
